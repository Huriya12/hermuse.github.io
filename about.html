            <p>Hi! This is Huriya De Jesus Zafar typing. 
            I am the creator of <i>Her Muse</i>â€¦ and this website on the little corner of the internet. 
            I started <i>Her Muse</i> as a personal space to share my ideas, thoughts, musings, and everything else that might be circling my mind. 
            It is an archive of my fleeting thoughts but shared and presented in something cooler. Here, I only intend to simply share brief glimpses of myself and my thoughts, as I deeply, deeply, deeply value my privacy. 
            Just a little disclaimer though, none of the contents on my website should be taken seriously, after all, this is just a simple space to express myself with no rules, no pressure, and no expectations. Just here to have fun, really.
            </p>
